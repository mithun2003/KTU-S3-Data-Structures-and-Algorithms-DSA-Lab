# 📘 KTU S3 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Lab

This repository contains the **DSA Lab experiments** implemented as part of the curriculum.  
Each experiment demonstrates important concepts of **arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, searching, sorting, and hashing**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each experiment is placed in a separate folder with proper source code, test cases, and documentation.
